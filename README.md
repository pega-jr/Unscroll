# Unscroll

Use Instagram on iOS without an infinite Reels feed.

Unscroll injects a small client-side limiter into a user-supplied, decrypted
Instagram IPA. It filters suggested Reels from Home and prevents endless Reel
chaining without intercepting or changing Instagram's network requests.

## Compatibility

| Instagram version | Status | Date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `444.0.0` | ✅ Success | August 29, 2026 |

## What stays and what goes

| Instagram feature | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Home feed | ✅ Works normally |
| Explore and search | ✅ Works normally |
| Stories, profiles, and direct messages | ✅ Work normally |
| A Reel opened from a message or profile | ✅ Still opens |
| Reels tab | ⚠️ Shows one Reel |
| Endless Reel chaining | ❌ Blocked |
| Suggested Reels carousel in Home | ❌ Hidden |

The Reels button remains visible and opens one Reel. Swiping or refreshing does
not expose more recommendations. A Reel opened from a message or profile gets its
own viewer and remains available.

Unscroll only hooks two Reels-specific data sources. It does not modify Story
requests or models, so viewing and posting Stories remain separate.

The same small runtime library keeps the signed app on its available keychain and
app-group containers so a force quit does not discard the login session. It also
prevents the sideloaded app from being mistaken for an expired TestFlight beta.

## Recommended: Build with GitHub Actions

1. Fork Unscroll on GitHub.
2. Host your decrypted Instagram IPA at an HTTPS direct-download URL.
3. Open **Actions → Build Unscroll IPA → Run workflow** in your fork.
4. Enter the URL in `ipa_url` and run the workflow.

The workflow builds `Unscroll.ipa` and creates a draft release.

## Build locally

You need:

- A Linux computer with internet access and Python 3.10 or newer
- A lawfully obtained, decrypted ARM64 Instagram IPA
- An iPhone running iOS 16.3 or newer

Clone Unscroll, then run the one-command builder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mihir-A/Unscroll.git
cd Unscroll
chmod +x ./unscroll-build
./unscroll-build /path/to/Instagram.ipa
```

The first run installs Theos, its iOS toolchain, and SDK under
`.build-tools/theos` inside the clone. The official Theos bootstrapper may ask for
`sudo` to install required Linux system packages. Subsequent builds reuse the
clone-local tools.

The result is `Unscroll.ipa` in the current directory. Choose another destination
with:

```bash
./unscroll-build --output /path/to/Unscroll.ipa /path/to/Instagram.ipa
```

Run `./unscroll-build --help` for advanced options, including retaining app
extensions or using an existing Theos installation.

The builder:

1. Installs and reuses a clone-local iOS build toolchain.
2. Builds one small library containing the Reels limiter and sideload fixes.
3. Confirms that the app executable is decrypted ARM64 code.
4. Injects the library without changing Instagram's network routes.
5. Removes bundled app extensions by default for easier sideload signing.
6. Rebuilds the IPA and checks every ZIP entry.

The client hooks target Instagram `444.0.0`. Instagram can rename its internal
classes at any time, so other versions may need updated hook names.

## Install

Sign and install `Unscroll.ipa` with your preferred iOS sideloading tool. For
[SideStore](https://sidestore.io/), open Apps, choose the `+` button, and select the
resulting IPA. A free Apple signing profile still needs to be refreshed on its
normal schedule.

When replacing an existing signed installation, use the same bundle identifier and
signing identity if you want the sideloading tool to preserve its data container.

## Troubleshooting

**The builder says the executable is encrypted.**

Unscroll cannot decrypt apps. Use a legitimately obtained decrypted IPA.

**The workflow cannot create its draft release.**

In the fork, open **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions**, select
**Read and write permissions**, save, and run the workflow again.

**Reels continue chaining.**

Confirm that the source IPA is Instagram `444.0.0` and rebuild it with the latest
Unscroll version. For another Instagram version, open an issue with its exact
version; do not attach the IPA.

**The app will not sign or install.**

Build without bundled extensions, which is the default, then let your sideloading
tool sign the rebuilt IPA.

**The account appears logged out after a force quit.**

Reinstall the new IPA over the existing sideloaded app where possible, then log in
once. The standard builder always injects `UnscrollRuntimeFix.dylib` and reports
that injection in its output.

**Instagram asks for a TestFlight beta update.**

Confirm that the build output reports `Injected client-side Reels limiter:
UnscrollRuntimeFix.dylib`.
